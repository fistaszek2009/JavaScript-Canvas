## About the Project
This repository contains **9 small exercises** exploring the **Canvas API in JavaScript**.  
The projects are inspired by the [MDN Canvas API tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).  

I followed the tutorial but extended the exercises, making them more **advanced and creative**.



## How to Use
- Each subproject has its own folder with all required files (except images).  
- You can also open [`main.html`](main.html), which contains all projects in one place. 
  
---
*I recommend opening `main.html` and then using **full screen mode** for each exercise.*

> [!WARNING]  
> Some projects **will not work when opened directly as local files**.  
> This is because they load images dynamically, and the **browser blocks cross-origin requests (CORS)** for local files.  
> To avoid this issue, run the project with a local server (e.g. *Live Server* extension in VS Code).
